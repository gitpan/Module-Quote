NAME
    Module::Quote - a quote-like operator that requires modules for you

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::More tests => 1;
            use Module::Quote;
        
            my $number = qm( Math::BigInt 1.00 )->new(42);
        
            isa_ok $number, "Math::BigInt";

DESCRIPTION
    The `qm()` quote-like operator will load a module and return its name. So
    the following should just work, even if you haven't `use`d Math::BigInt in
    advance.

            qm( Math::BigInt 1.00 )->new(42)

    The more usual invocation:

            Math::BigInt->new(42)

    won't automatically load Math::BigInt, won't check a version number, and
    crucially is ambiguous! (See what happens when you define a sub called
    `BigInt` in the `Math` package.)

    The `qm` operator interpolates variables, so this works too:

            my $x = "BigInt 1.00";
            qm( Math::$x )->new(42);

    You may export `qm` with an alternative name:

            use Module::Quote 'qmod';

    You may provide a hashref of options for the quote-like operator:

            use Module::Quote qm => { emulate => 'q' };

    You can export the operator multiple times with different options:

            use Module::Quote
                    qm  => { emulate => 'q' },
                    qqm => { emulate => 'qq' },
            ;

    The `optimistic` and `prefix` options from Module::Hash are supported. As
    is `emulate` which can be set to "qq" (the default) or "q" (to disable
    interpolation).
